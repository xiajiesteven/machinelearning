machine learning for finance





My life in US started from August 2009, as a graduate student in Columbia University in the city of New York.  After five years’ study and research in mathematics, especially algebraic geometry, I received my PhD degree from Columbia University in June 2014.   I was invited to Max Planck Institute of Mathematics as a postdoc researcher. 

After my postdoc study, I was eager to apply my knowledge and technical skills to industry. Thus I joined Morgan Stanley in June 2015.

My professional career started as a modeller in interest rate trading desk of Fixed Income Division. My responsibilities included, yet not restricted to, that develop new valuation adjustment model and calibration tools, design and improve hedging strategies in a portfolio level. During more than one year working experience in interest rates trading desk, I have gained market knowledge on bonds, treasuries, swaps, bond futures, swaptions, constant maturity swaps and other more exotic products, across different currencies. I have also sharpened and strengthened my coding skills. I have developed several tools/apps in firm-wide risk calculation system in Scala and C++. 

Then I transferred to commodities trading desk, also in Fixed Income Division. There I worked as a trading strategist, closely with traders and sales. 
I provide quantitative solutions to power & gas team, coverage including modelling, pricing, fundamental analysis etc. 
I am deeply involved with large or exotic transactions with power plants, utilities and other clients, from the very early stage. I build energy-related pricing models and backtest tools for exotic instruments such as tolling, revenue puts, contingent extendibles, gas storages and battery etc. I tailor the models and tools for different customers’ demand, while maintain enough profit margin for the desk. 
I am also responsible for some fundamental analysis and forecast in power and gas market. For example, I developed and maintained forecast models for hydroelectricity generation, and power prices under the impact of solar power.  I have also designed hedging strategies for exotic structures.
During the conversation with traders and clients, I gained lots of sense for power and natural gas market in different regions of US, engineering knowledge on electricity generation and transmission, and incentives for renewable energy development. 
All above models are implemented in matlab and C++. 

Besides daily work, I have also participated in other team and firm activities. I volunteered to help NGO, clean and maintain parks and  public spaces three years in a row. I have also actively participated in the JPM Corporate Challenges, representing Morgan Stanley.
