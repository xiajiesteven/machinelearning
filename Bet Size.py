# inputs:
#    events: a matrix of data, with column = meta-labelling estimator, or a standard labeling estimator.
#    stepSize: a double
#    prob: a matrix with size = events.index  * 1. Each entry = max of output from ML classification algorithm (a numClass * 1 vector)
#    pred: a matrix with size = events.index * 1. Each entry is the bet size corresponding to prob variable above.  
#    numClasses: the number of classes out of the ML algorithm, an int
# Outputs:
#   signal1 is the average bet size of the asset/portfolio. Mathematically it's 2* norm.cdf(signal0) - 1
